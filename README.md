# Lottery
A gambling game made in Rust. This app was made inspired by the "Mega Sena da virada" (the new year's eve lottery which happens in Brazil) with the intent to show how hard it is to get all the right numbers of the lottery and also to show how much you need to spend to win the game.

The prize is R$ 500.0000.000,000 and the app keeps track of how many times the player tried to guess the numbers and how much fictional money was spent.

The executable file is at : `target\debug\lottery.exe`
